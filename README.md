# Appointment scheduler in Xamarin.Forms
This app loads the appointments in a calendar and allows you to reschedule the appointments by drag and drop and add new appointments. It also provides four different types of views such as day view, week view, work week view, and month view to manage your schedule in a perfect way.

## Syncfusion Controls

This project uses the following Syncfusion controls:

* [SfSchedule](https://www.syncfusion.com/xamarin-ui-controls/scheduler) - To show the appointments.
* [SfDataForm](https://www.syncfusion.com/xamarin-ui-controls/dataform) - To add a new appointment.
